//if i want to make this there are certain challnegese i have to think through

//collsion: i know for a fact drawing the cercles is going to be the easest part, its the collison and overlapping of the circles that will EAT ME UP.
//there is only one fix and its to write something that checks for collision and then doesnt allow it
//thats a lie what if i just give every ellispe a margin of like 20 px or 10 px that should fix everything. the canva would need to be big though 
//scaler is another intersing thing im going to have to figure out. i could just grap every value an times it by 10 or somthing.
//i could usse the same color array method i found for my stacked chart for the colors of the balls. this way i could just put a bunch of colors in the array an not worry about allocating them.
//tmmr im going to go crazy
